Hi!
My name is Konstantin. I'm starting to take the course "Neural Network Developer". Before this, I had no experience writing code, except for being a student. Therefore, I will write only a little personal information =)
I have a higher education at the Tomsk University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics, majoring in Radioelectronic Systems and Complexes.
